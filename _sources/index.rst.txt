BenchOpt is a package to simplify and make more transparent and
reproducible the comparisons of optimization algorithms.

It involves the definition of objective functions, datasets
and solvers. Once you have defined a benchmark as explained
at :ref:`how`, making comparison figures becomes (hopefully) surprisingly easy!

BenchOpt is typically used through a command line as documented
in :ref:`api_documentation`.
